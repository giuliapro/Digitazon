    <h3>History, purpose and usage</h3>
    <p>
      <i>Lorem ipsum</i>, or <i>lipsum</i> as it is sometimes known, is dummy
      text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is
      attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to
      have scrambled parts of Cicero's <i>De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</i> for
      use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The purpose of <i>lorem ipsum</i> is to create a natural looking block of
      text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the
      layout. A practice not without <span class="underline">controversy</span>, laying out pages with
      meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be
      on design, not content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when
      Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as
      desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen
      all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our
